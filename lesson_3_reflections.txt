Question:
  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer:
  Whenever you are collaborating with someone or want to have an easily accessed version online, be it for access from a different computer or just to have a backup.

Question:
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer:
  Because someone might make changes to it that you don't want to pull as you're in the middle of something else.

Question:
  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Answer:
  Forks are used to create your version of someone else's repository on GitHub, clones do the same but on your local, and branches create versions of a repository you already have.

Question:
  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Answer:
  You can check back to see how things were before you messed with it without having internet access.

Question:
  How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Answer:
  Would probably have to use dropbox and manual comparing with specific versions saved separately.

Question:
  When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Answer:
  Primarily you make changes in branches whenever the change has the potential to break master or is something you want to keep separate from master for some other reason. When collaborating, it's also best to make branches for everything and just do pull requests to merge them into master to make sure you don't change anything someone else might be depending on without either of you noticing.
