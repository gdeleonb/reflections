Question:
  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer:
  Whenever you are collaborating with someone or want to have an easily accessed version online, be it for access from a different computer or just to have a backup.

Question:
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer;
  Because someone might make changes to it that you don't want to pull as you're in the middle of something else.

Question:
  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Answer:
  Forks are used to create your version of someone else's repository on GitHub, clones do the same but on your local, and branches create versions of a repository you already have.
